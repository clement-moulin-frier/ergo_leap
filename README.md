To run this code you will need to:
* An [Ergo-robot](http://poppy-project.github.io/pypot/quickstart.html) and a proper installation of the [Pypot library](http://poppy-project.github.io/pypot/).
* A [Leap Motion] and a proper installation of the [Leap Motion SDK](https://developer.leapmotion.com/) (we will use the Python API).

Then follow the detailled intruction in the IPython notebook file (.ipynb, that you can vizualize [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/clement-moulin-frier/ergo_leap/blob/master/ergo_leap.ipynb)).
